Description: Our shop window on the maritime worlds is located directly on the Kiel Fjord and invites you to discover domestic but also exotic underwater worlds .
    Various animal species from the North and Baltic Seas, the Mediterranean and the tropics live on 350 m² of exhibition space. Our group of seals entertains visitors in the freely accessible outdoor enclosure. Special highlights are the feeding, where our seals like to show some tricks ...
    With more than 80,000 visitors a year, our GEOMAR aquarium is one of the tourist attractions of the Schleswig-Holstein state capital. A visit as a family with children, with the school class or kindergarten - it is always worth it, regardless of the weather.
